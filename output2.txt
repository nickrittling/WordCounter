    AND THEN THEY SAY NO SPIRIT DARE STIR ABROAD
    THE NIGHTS ARE WHOLESOME THEN NO PLANETS STRIKE
    NO FAIRY TAKES NOR WITCH HATH POWER TO CHARM
    SO HALLOWD AND SO GRACIOUS IS THE TIME

    I AM SORRY THAT WITH BETTER HEED AND JUDGMENT
    I HAD NOT QUOTED HIM I FEARD HE DID BUT TRIFLE
    AND MEANT TO WRACK THEE BUT BESHREW MY JEALOUSY
    BY HEAVEN IT IS AS PROPER TO OUR AGE
    TO CAST BEYOND OURSELVES IN OUR OPINIONS
    AS IT IS COMMON FOR THE YOUNGER SORT
    TO LACK DISCRETION COME GO WE TO THE KING
    THIS MUST BE KNOWN WHICH BEING KEPT CLOSE MIGHT MOVE
    MORE GRIEF TO HIDE THAN HATE TO UTTER LOVE
